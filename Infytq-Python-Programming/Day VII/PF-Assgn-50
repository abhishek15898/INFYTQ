/*

Write python function, sms_encoding() which accepts a sentence and converts it into an abbreviated sentence to be sent as SMS and returns the abbreviated sentence. 

Rules are as follows: 
a. Spaces are to be retained as is 
b. Each word should be encoded separately

If a word has only vowels then retain the word as is
If a word has a consonant (at least 1) then retain only those consonants

Note: Assume that the sentence would begin with a word and there will be only a single space between the words.

              Sample Input	                                 Expected Output
      I love Python	I                                          lv Pythn
