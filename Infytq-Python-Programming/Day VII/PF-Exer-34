/*
We have ‘N’ flavors of toppings that can be added to a coffee. For example  chocolate, hazelnut, vanilla, Irish and so on. 

Write a function that takes the number of available flavors as input and returns the total number of different ways we can have our coffee. Note that we can have coffee without any toppings or with different combination of toppings.
