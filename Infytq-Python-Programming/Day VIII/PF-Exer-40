/*

Write a python lambda expression for calculating sum of two numbers and find out whether the sum is divisible by 10 or not.


Test your code by using the given sample inputs. 
Verify your code by using the 2nd sample input(highlighted) given below:

Sample Input	              Expected Output
num1 = 5
num2 = 10	              Not Divisible by 10

num1 = 20
num2 = 30

#PF-Exer-40
#This verification is based on string match.

num1=10
num2=10

div = lambda num1,num2: (num1+num2)

if(div(num1,num2)%10)==0:
    #write your logic here
    print("Divisible By 10")
else:
    print("Not divisible By 10")
