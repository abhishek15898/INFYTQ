/*

An organization has decided to provide salary hike to its employees based on their job level. Employees can be in job levels 3 , 4 or 5. 
Hike percentage based on job levels are given below:


Job level	Hike Percentage (applicable on current salary)
3	15
4	7
5	5
In case of invalid job level, consider hike percentage to be 0.


Given the current salary and job level, write a python program to find and display the new salary of an employee. Identify the test data and use it to test the program.
