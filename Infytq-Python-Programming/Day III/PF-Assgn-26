/*
Write a python program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle.

We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have? 

Estimated time: 15 minutes

Sample Input	      Expected Output
heads-150 legs-400	   100 50
heads-3 legs-11	       No solution
heads-3 legs-12	       0 3
heads-5 legs-10	       5 0
