/*
ARS Gems Store sells different varieties of gems to its customers.

Write a Python program to calculate the bill amount to be paid by a customer based on the list of gems and quantity purchased. Any purchase with a total bill amount above Rs.30000 is entitled for 5% discount. If any gem required by the customer is not available in the store, then consider total bill amount to be -1.

Assume that quantity required by the customer for any gem will always be greater than 0.

Perform case-sensitive comparison wherever applicable.
