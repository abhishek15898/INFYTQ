"Nine is considered as a lucky number in Chinese culture because it sounds the same as the word "long-lasting".
The registration number of a car is considered to be lucky if the registration number adds up to 9. 
The registration number will always be a 4 digit number.

Example 1:
9099 is considered to be good as
9+0+9+9=27
2+7=9

Example 2: 
2036 is considered to be not good as
2+0+3+6=11
1+1=2
